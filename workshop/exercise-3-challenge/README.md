# The DOM Workshop

## Exercise 3 - Counting down!

_This exercise is optional._

### The Task

Create two pages.

1. homepage (`index.html`) that displays the current time and a link to:
2. stopwatch page (`/stopwatch.html`) that starts a timer as soon as the page loads, and displays the time elapsed (updating once a second)

If you have some time ðŸ˜‰, and the inclination, you can make it look "decent." Go as wild as you like. It doesn't need to be complicated, just a little "purty."
